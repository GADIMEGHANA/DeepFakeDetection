# DeepFakeDetection
Deepfake Detection: Tools and algorithms to identify synthetic media using neural networks, digital forensics, and dataset analysis. Built with TensorFlow.

MODEL DESCRIPTION
  This deepfake detection model is a powerful tool designed to identify AI-generated images and videos with precision. Built using   TensorFlow, Keras and the EfficientNetB3 architecture, it combines transfer learning   and   fine-tuning   to adapt a pre-trained model for detecting subtle artifacts in synthetic media. Developed in   Google Colab  , the project emphasizes ease of use and scalability, featuring automatic dataset organization, dynamic class balancing, and advanced data augmentation techniques to handle real-world challenges. The model not only delivers high accuracy but also provides detailed insights through metrics like AUC, precision, and recall. Whether you're a researcher or developer, this solution offers a reliable way to tackle the growing issue of deepfakes, with support for TensorFlow Lite to enable deployment on edge devices.
